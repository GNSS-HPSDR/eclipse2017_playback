These are some Gnuradio flowgraphs and bash shell scripts I put together
to manipulate the data I collected during the 2017 solar eclipse.

The Gnuradio Companion .grc files require the MIT-Haystack digital_rf
blocks to be installed: https://github.com/MITHaystack/digital_rf.

The bash shell script (".sh") files are minimalist, do no error or sanity
checking, and were thrown together mainly so I didn't have to type
a bunch of parameters each time I wanted to process a file.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK!!!
